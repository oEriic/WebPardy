This is a website made based on the game Jeopardy! created for a project in a web development class.

Using HTML/CSS and PHP only to design the pages and forms and sessions, 
the project consists of a homepage that allows for signup or login, a main questions page, and a leaderboard page.

It allows for four players to try and answer the questions, and when the users are finished,
they can log out and the session will be cleared.
